A website with learning materials for WAT (Military University of Technology), based on Vue 3, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Project Structure
The materials are organized by subjects. Each subject can have its own subcategories (e.g., Reports, Theory, Notes), contained as subfolders *(TODO)*:
```
public/
â””â”€â”€ files/
    â”œâ”€â”€ fizyka/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Sprawozdania/
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Sprawko1.pdf
    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.json
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.json
    â”œâ”€â”€ aok/
    â””â”€â”€ jee/
```
Due to the size (as well as the number) of files, they are obviously not stored in the repository; however, they are available on the [WAT Center website](https://wat.21152115.xyz) (Yes, I bought a .xyz domain because it was ridiculously cheap, don't blame me).

## Features (some still TODO)
- ðŸ”„ Dynamic route generation for subjects and their subcategories using Vue Router
- ðŸ”„ Support for not only files but also links to external materials
- ðŸ”„ Built-in PDF viewer and image preview
- âœ… Automatic generation of index.json for all folders and subfolders (Node.js)
- âœ… Minimalist and responsive design with Tailwind CSS
